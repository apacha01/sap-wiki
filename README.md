# Frontend web for the `sapi` API.

This is the frontend part of the full web app with [this backend](https://github.com/apacha01/sapi). It is mainly a wiki, but it offers the login to change any information on the page through the API.

This app is the conclusion for the Programming subject in the IT career that i'm doing. Since it's an assignment there was a time limit and i didn't get to make everything with the best practices or how i would have liked it to be. However, that's only the CRUD part along with the login system, since no one as the admin rights the page is, for the general public, really nice in my opinion.

## Installation
* Clone the repo and run `npm i` in that directory.
* That should be it, with `npm run dev` you can run it locally on port `4321` (used astro)

## TODO
- [ ] CRUD in all models but Pet.
- [ ] Include Pagination.
- [ ] Improve login system.
